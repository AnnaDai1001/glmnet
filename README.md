[glmnet on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html)

Extremely efficient procedures for fitting the entire lasso or elastic-net regularization path for linear regression, logistic
and multinomial regression models, poisson regression and the Cox model. Two recent additions are the multiresponse gaussian,
and the grouped multinomial. The algorithm uses cyclical coordinate descent in a pathwise fashion, as described in the paper listed below.
